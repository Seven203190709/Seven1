<h2>Customer information management system</h2>

<h3>Project Introduction</h3>

<h6>An IT project I want to do is a customer information management system.<br>For a business to improve its profitability, the most important thing is its customers. Only after the company masters and manages customer information can it better serve customers and improve customer satisfaction. This customer information management system can collect customer information and make it into a searchable database.<br>To build this customer information management system, you need MySQL, MySQL is a relational database management system, relational database keeps data in different tables instead of putting all data in one big warehouse, which increases speed and improves flexibility. The hardware uses the Cisco hardware firewall, and the firewall program is built into the chip, which can reduce the burden on the CPU and make the routing more stable.</h6>
